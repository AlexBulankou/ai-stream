== Application Insights Telemetry Stream ==

This Application Insights add-on lets you view telemetry items from the browser
as they are issued by Application Insights. 

This is helpful in situations when you need to see what is happening with your 
application right this very second and cannot get to Azure portal or when 
telemetry indexing by Application Insights pipeline is delayed. 

Essentially this add-on lets you view the same data you see in your Visual 
Studio debug output window, except from production.
